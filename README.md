As a reader in today's world, the recommendations, reviews, etc, are through the internet and there is a large community of readers on social media. 

Becouse of my love for books i developed this web application in collaboration with a booktoker to create this platform for the comunity.

In the application the user can vote for a book in each award, this information is obtained from the CMS. Also, the user can vote for a book that is not presented in the options where I used the Google Books API to obtain the data.
